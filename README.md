# coverflow-template

Static 3D coverflow one-page portfolio template (HTML/CSS/JS).

## Getting started
- Open `index.html` directly in any modern browser.
- No build step or dependencies.

## Contributing
- For UI changes, include before/after screenshots in PRs.
- Keep HTML/CSS/JS vanilla and lightweight.

## A quick joke
Why do programmers prefer dark mode?
Because light attracts bugs.

## A quick pun
This template has great *cover flow*—it really knows how to *turn heads*.

## A limerick
There once was a page with a spin,
Whose covers would glide with a grin.
With CSS in sync,
And some JavaScript ink,
It made portfolios feel like a win.

## A haiku about death
Silent final breath,
Autumn leaves release their hold—
Night folds into dawn.
