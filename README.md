# coverflow-template

Static 3D coverflow one-page portfolio template (HTML/CSS/JS).

## Getting started
- Open `index.html` directly in any modern browser.
- No build step or dependencies.

## Contributing
- For UI changes, include before/after screenshots in PRs.
- Keep HTML/CSS/JS vanilla and lightweight.

## A quick joke
Why do programmers prefer dark mode?
Because light attracts bugs.

## A quick pun
This template has great *cover flow*—it really knows how to *turn heads*.

## A limerick
There once was a page with a spin,
Whose covers would glide with a grin.
With CSS in sync,
And some JavaScript ink,
It made portfolios feel like a win.

## A sonnet
Upon the screen, the covers take their flight,
In measured arcs of depth and shadowed sheen;
They turn like thoughts that wander through the night,
And settle, poised, where focus might have been.

No heavy forge of builds, no clanging chain—
Just HTML, and style’s quiet art;
A script to set the rhythm in the lane,
And motion’s small persuasion plays its part.

Here portfolios parade in graceful rows,
Each image briefly monarch of the frame;
A gentle wheel that, as it circles, shows
How simple code can earn a vivid name.

So keep it lean; let elegance suffice—
For lightness lends the turning form its spice.
