## A quick joke
Why do programmers prefer dark mode?
Because light attracts bugs.

## A quick pun
This template has great *cover flow*—it really knows how to *turn heads*.

## A limerick
There once was a page with a spin,
Whose covers would glide with a grin.
With CSS in sync,
And some JavaScript ink,
It made portfolios feel like a win.

## A sonnet about penguins
Upon the floes where winter draws its frame,
Black-tuxedoed custodians of the cold,
They stitch the sea with stitches smooth as flame,
And draft the dawn in argent, blue, and gold.

They court the wind with bows of quiet grace,
And promenade on ice in measured time;
A chorus etched in feather, beak, and face,
Whose metronome is surf and polar chime.

Though tempests drum and iron midnights press,
They harbor suns within their gathered throng;
An ember passed from breast to breast's caress,
A warmth that makes the longest darkness long.

O steadfast birds, in snow's cathedral bright,
You teach the art of holding fast to light.
