## Comment: Merits of having cats as pets

Cats make rewarding companions for a wide range of households. They offer genuine affection and companionship while fitting comfortably into modern, busy lifestyles. Key merits include:

- Low maintenance daily care: Most cats are litter-trained and groom themselves, reducing the need for frequent baths or outdoor walks. Routine feeding, periodic nail trims, and regular litter-box upkeep typically cover day-to-day needs.
- Apartment- and city-friendly: Cats thrive in smaller spaces and tend to be quieter than many other pets, making them well-suited to apartments and shared living environments.
- Independent yet affectionate: Cats are comfortable spending stretches of time on their own, but many are also highly social and enjoy cuddling, play, and human interaction—on their own terms.
- Stress relief and wellbeing: The presence of a cat can be calming; purring has been associated with relaxation, and pet ownership is often linked to lower stress levels and improved mood.
- Natural pest control: Many cats have a strong hunting instinct, which can help deter or reduce household pests.
- Cost and time efficiency: While all pets require responsible care and veterinary attention, cats generally require less time and equipment than many dogs, and can be more budget-friendly over the long term.
- Enrichment fits modern routines: Short, frequent play sessions with toys or interactive feeders provide healthy stimulation without demanding long outdoor excursions.
- Cleanliness and indoor living: Indoor cats typically live longer, face fewer hazards, and, with regular litter maintenance and basic grooming, can keep a tidy home environment.
- Environmental considerations: Compared with large pets, cats often have a smaller resource footprint. Keeping cats indoors also helps protect local wildlife.

Responsible ownership remains essential: adopting from shelters, spaying/neutering, providing routine veterinary care, and ensuring enrichment and social interaction all contribute to a healthy, happy cat and a harmonious home.
